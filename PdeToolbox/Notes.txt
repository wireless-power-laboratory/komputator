Depends on which PDEs you want to solve and how you want to approach them.

Every approach that I know of will require linear algebra. You'll want to find a good matrix package for .NET, the best you can find, one that can handle 
	sparse matricies efficiently.

Linear elliptic (steady state diffusion), parabolic (transient diffusion), and hyperbolic (F= MA dynamic) PDEs require slightly different approaches.

All three of these PDEs can use classical finite difference, finite element (weighted residual), or boundary element (Green's functions) to create the 
	system matrix you'd like to solve. General non-linear PDEs are probably best attacked using a finite element/weighted residual technique.

But the parabolic and hyperbolic PDFs will turn into coupled sets of ODEs once you discretize them. You have to do transient integration to repeatedly 
	solve the time evolution. Parabolic ODEs are first order in time; hyperbolic ODEs are second order in time.
